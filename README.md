# Description

This tool downloads all photos you're tagged in on Facebook. You will be prompted for your username and password. A Chrome window will then open to Facebook, log you in, navigate to Photos of You, and start downloading. Because it uses a fresh Chrome instance, it will save the pictures to your default Downloads directory (`C:\Users\You\Downloads` or `~/Downloads`), though you can change this during the transfer in Chrome's settings. It does not handle videos.

# Setup and Use

- Install Node.js/NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Download or clone this repo (then unzip to a folder if downloading: https://github.com/spieglt/fb-photos/archive/master.zip)
- Open your terminal or command prompt or Powershell and navigate to the fb-photos folder
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies, wait for it to finish
- Run `node ./index.js`, follow the prompts, and press `Enter`
- When the Chrome window appears, click `Allow` or `Block` to the prompt for Facebook to send you notifications, and then click `Allow` when prompted to let Chrome download multiple files.
